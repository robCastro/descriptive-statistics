# Descriptive Statistics

This repo contains all my exercises for the descriptive statistics course, wich is part of the ML and IA career in Platzi.

It comes with the notebooks with my thoughts on the work and also comes with the datasets that I worked with.

If you want, you can check my progress [here](https://platzi.com/p/recastro/).
